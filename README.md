# First-FullStackDapp
This dAap is a demonstration of how to interact with a deployed contract of sepolia testnet with a basic html and css front end by using ethers.JS library. 

I have refered to the LearnWeb3DAO for creating this Daap

There were some problems that i have faced while following through the tutorial 
The cdn link used in the tutorial and the cdn link on the officials etheres website is not up to date
To solve this issue you can just change the number 5.2 in the cdn file from the ethers website to 5.7 
Then all things can be fixed 

And even after that you are not able to do it then i will suggest you to follow through the video provided by the LearnWeb3DAO at the start of the tutoral.
